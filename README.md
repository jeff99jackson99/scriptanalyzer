```

## Customization

The app is designed to work with any script that follows a numbered question format. To customize for your specific script:

1. **Modify Flow Logic**: Update the `get_next_question()` method in `needgod_app.py` to match your script's decision tree
2. **Add Quick Answers**: Customize the quick answer buttons based on common responses in your script
3. **Enhance Parsing**: Improve the `parse_script()` method to better extract questions and flow logic from your specific script format

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- PyPDF2
- pandas

## Troubleshooting

- **PDF not found**: Ensure `needgodscript.pdf` is in the project directory
- **Import errors**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Script not loading**: Check that `script_content.txt` was created successfully
- **Flow not working**: Verify the script parsing logic matches your PDF format
